# Java_Encoder-Decoder
Java Encoder/Decoder based off the vigenere cipher + 1

// VIGENERE CIPHER
/*
 * In this cipher, as per historically accurate, using an "a" or "aaa" any variation here will NOT encrypt
 * the input string in any way. This is because we as programmers begin counting at 0, and assigning a to the
 * value of 0, as it is the first digit, then a shift to the entire string by 0 makes for no variation.
 * To check my work I utilized http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere.php, I am in no way affiliated with 
 * the creators of this website nor the code they used to create their version of the cipher. 
 * 
 * If one wishes for a to be a shift of 1 and z's to become the "zero shift" character, replace all 97's in
 * this code to 96's. Thank you.
